Ever wanted to make a plant monitoring system for your garden but put off by the amount of coding required. Well, I have some good news.

# What is Pi plant monitoring?

Pi-plant-monitoring is a web app designed to help users create their custom plant monitoring system and a web page to view all the data, all with a few clicks.

## How to use?

Detailed instructions on our [github](./) page.


1. Attach your sensors to the raspberry pi. A [guide].(./) is available.

2. Sign up at [Link to website](./). Choose your system settings( sensors used, measurement timing etc. ). A python file will be generated based on your preferences.

3. Simply upload and run the main script on your pi and `viola!` your work is done.

A database is automatically created for you to hold your data. You can see the data pouring in the dashboard view.

Now you can customise your display. Place your charts displaying at any portion of your dashboard view. You can also create charts to view trends in your data. Simply choose the sensor and the dates.
